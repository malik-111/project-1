# project-1

done majority of the website
what needs to be done:
  - could not figure out a way to take an item and add it to a basket, when its respective button was clicked.
    - as it was reading the items from a file, and i was using a for loop, it would just get the last item in the file (pizza 15)
  - basket.html and its css was taken from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEJHSPM-Qiw, and was to be used as a foundation for my own basket page
    - did not achieve this cos of my time managment
